# SimpleEqTutorial
I followed a 5 hours tutorial on how to use juce  framework to create an equalizer

Because I really want to learn how to properly manage sound with the goal to create plugins, I'm trying to learn how to use juce framework.
For this purpose, I discovered this Tutorial :

I really want to thanks this guy for the knowledge he gave to me, such a nice overview and greats explainations.

If you wants to run it on your own, you should download juce framework.

I might put the VST created in the repository as well.
